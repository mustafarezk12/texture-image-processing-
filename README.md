What is Texture?

There are two kinds of texture: one is tactile and the other one is optical, where we can feel the tactile texture by touching or seeing the surface. When we talk about the optical or visual texture, it refers to the shape and content of the image. Humans can easily diagnose the texture of the image but making a machine to analyze the texture of the image has its complexity. In the field of image processing, we can consider the spatial changes of the brightness intensity of the pixel as the texture of the image.
